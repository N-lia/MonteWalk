### r/algotrading
**Title**: [Open Source] MonteWalk - MCP server that gives Claude institutional-grade trading tools

**Body**:
```
Hey r/algotrading!

I built MonteWalk for the MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon - it's an open-source server that connects AI assistants (like Claude) to professional trading infrastructure.

**What it does:**
- Gives your AI access to 25 trading tools via Model Context Protocol
- Paper trading with $100K virtual capital (Alpaca)
- Real-time data: stocks, crypto, news, sentiment
- Risk analytics: VaR, Monte Carlo, drawdown
- Backtesting with walk-forward analysis
- Portfolio optimization (mean-variance, risk parity)

**Why MCP?**
Instead of building yet another standalone trading bot, I wanted to augment existing AI assistants. You can literally ask Claude "What's my portfolio risk?" or "Backtest a 10/50 MA crossover on AAPL" and it uses MonteWalk's tools.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python (FastMCP, Gradio 6)
- Alpaca (paper trading API)
- yfinance, CoinGecko, NewsAPI
- FinBERT sentiment (Modal serverless)

**Live Demo:** [HF_SPACE_URL]
**GitHub:** [GITHUB_URL]

Try it out and LMK what you think! Open to PRs and feature requests.

**Text**:
```
Hey HN!

I built MonteWalk for the MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon. It's an MCP server that gives AI assistants like Claude access to quantitative trading infrastructure.

The Model Context Protocol (https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you extend AI assistants with custom tools. MonteWalk provides 25 trading tools: market data, paper trading, risk analytics, backtesting, portfolio optimization, and sentiment analysis.

**Demo:** [HF_SPACE_URL]
**Code:** [GITHUB_URL]

**Why this matters:**
- Retail traders lack institutional-grade tools (VaR, Monte Carlo, optimization)
- Data is scattered across platforms (stocks, crypto, news)
- AI assistants can't connect to live markets

MonteWalk bridges this gap. You can ask Claude "What's my portfolio VaR?" or "Run a morning briefing" and it orchestrates multi-step workflows using real market data.

Built with:
- Gradio 6 (UI + MCP server)
- Alpaca (paper trading)
- FinBERT sentiment (Modal serverless)
- Multi-source data aggregation

Everything is paper trading only (no real money risk). Perfect for learning algorithmic trading or testing strategies.

Happy to answer questions!
